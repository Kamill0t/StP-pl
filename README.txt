This repository contains essential files for translating Slay the Princess game into polish.

(The translation is currently a work-in-progress)

In order to play the game with the translation:
* You must own Slay the Princess - End of Everything version.
* Copy the game files in case something goes wrong
* Copy all the contents of this repository to the root game directory where it is installed.
  No files should be replaced, but the game should be able to recognize the extra content.
* Launch the game
* In the Preferences there should be a setting available to switch to Polish.
