This repository contains essential files for translating Slay the Princess game into polish.

In order to play the game with the translation:
* Copy the game in case something goes wrong
* Copy all the contents to the root game directory where it is installed.
  No files should be replaced, but the game should be able to recognize the extra content.
* In the Preferences there should be a setting available to switch to Polish.
